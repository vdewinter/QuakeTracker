QuakeTracker
============
![alt tag] (https://github.com/vdewinter/QuakeTracker/blob/master/QuakeTracker.png)

QuakeTracker is an interactive visualization of earthquakes magnitude 3 or greater from the past week and all earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater since 1900 colored and sized by magnitude. This app maintains a websocket connection to a USGS server, which issues GeoJSON reports of new earthquakes every minute. New earthquakes are added to the map dynamically.


Click on the labeled circles to filter recent or historical earthquakes by magnitude. Use the slider to display quakes since 1900 by year. Hover over any map point for information about an earthquake's magnitude and when it occurred.
