goal: find a project
Today I decided on a project, drew mockups, collected the earthquake and tsunami DB's from USGS and NOAA.

7/8/14
goal: make a 3d globe with three.js, get realtime data source for earthquakes/tsunamis, created my own DB(currently sqlite, in the future postgres), get higher quality images and limit zoom distance
-I'll have to scrape the NOAA site for tsunami live updates, but I can use the USGS API to get GeoJSON for quakes.
- I created DB and tables before running seed.py by doing the following:
    python -i model.py
    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///ratings.db", echo=True)
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

7/9/14
goal: plot 2d data on sphere
Three js was giving me problems implementing a cube mat layer over the globe (maybe due to my blog post I used as an example having a different version from my copy?), and the error has to do with no material list being passed into MeshFaceMaterial, for future debugging purposes. I will try the Google Data Arts Team's globe for now to get an MVP working and come back to implementing my own globe if there is time. I also decided I will use a Flask web socket to connect with USGS and make live updates every minute.

7/10/14
goal: plot data on Google Data Arts Team WebGL Globe- be able to select vectors, d3 to display data from DB? 
My concern today is being able to make GET requests when clicking on the cubes that the globe generates. Stackoverflow says I need to implement a raycaster to make three js objects clickable. 
turnout- I'm moving to 2d with d3.js- much better support for geodata.

goal: plot historical data on d3 map
d3 has a different style of programming from what I'm used to- declarative, not imperative (e.g. the .enter() method, callbacks with d instead of for loops). I found a good example of a project I want mine to end up similar to - realtime data reported back with blinking circles. I want to see the JSON they pass and better understand the .data() and .datum().
.data computes a join (declaratively adds new elts, however many are in the array passed to it). It associates the data at each elt to the __data__ property of each new HTML elt created. .datum does not perform join- use when you expect no dynamic updates.

goal: plot historical data on d3 map
DONE finally. Also got tectonic plates on the map. Next step is the timeline slider.
I'd like to explore the orthographic projection/make an interactive globe the user can drag to spin. 

7/13/14
Day of rest. Read a little about timelines and basic d3 stuff. Started to implement timeline. I plan to focus just on earthquakes with a timeline and realtime updates for my MVP.



LATER:
add foreign key b/t quakes and tsunamis?
scrape NOAA for realtime tsunami data and integrate USGS GeoJSON
use geocoding API to take user to lat/lon of a given search location ?
create tour guide feature
migrate to postgres
deploy on heroku
